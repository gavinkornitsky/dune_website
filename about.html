    <h2>Dune in Mainstream Media</h2>
    <p>Despite being one of the greatest pieces of literature to ever be written, Dune never got the respect and attention it deserves.
       Most people think about Dune as a series similar to Star Wars, but this is far from the real truth. The series share some common
       traits but are very different. Star Wars is very simple and can be understood by all audiences whereas Dune is a complex, confusing,
       and long story that takes some patience to get into. This barrier was recently destroyed though, with the release of the first two 
       Dune movies. The movies featured prominent actors like Timothee Chalamet, Zendaya, and Jason Mamo. The first two movies saw incredible sucess 
       and a third is already in the works. Most importantly, now people know Dune, they know Paul Atreides and understand his story. As a 
       huge Dune fan, I was so excited to see my friends finally understanding my nerdy obsession. ALong with the release of a new spinoff show,
       it is safe to say that Dune is here to stay in pop culture.
