              feudal interstellar society, the series explores themes of politics, religion, ecology, and human potenital. The narrative follows the
              Atreides family and most importantly, Paul Atreides. Paul is the heir to the Atreides family and is destined to become a central figure
              in a universe plagued by conflict and power struggles. The series begins with Dune, where Pauls family where Paul's family is entrusted 
              with the desert planet Arrakis, the only known source of the spice melange-a powerful substance that extends life, enhances ones mental
              abilities, and enables space travel. The spice is the most valuable substance in the Dune universe, and the enemies of the Atreides will 
              do anything within their power to control it. As the war for Arrakis is fought, Paul embarks on a prophetic journey, discovering his ability
              to see the future and ultimately embracing his role as a messianic figure to the Fremen, the indidgenous people of Arrakis. Herbert masterfully weaves
              philosophical questions about destiny, leadership, and environmentalism into the narrative while building a detailed world with complex characters.
              The series as a whole is an incredible journey that anyone should consider embarking on.
